Contributing :heart:
====================

Thanks for your interest! In order to keep the code coherent there are some
easy-to-follow rules.

 * Use [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com) and respect the `.jshintrc` file.
 * Use [EditorConfig](http://www.editorconfig.com) and respect the
   `.editorconfig` file.
 * Write test for your modifications (use `mocha` and `chai` modules).
 * Keep the code coverage as high as possible (100% is awesome!). Install
   `istanbul` module and run `npm run coverage` to check it.
 * Proudly add yourself to the contributors in `package.json`! :+1:
